Combinatorial differential geometry and ideal Bianchi-Ricci identities  II - the torsion case;;; Josef Jany&#x161;ka,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Markl_M/0/1/0/all/0/1">Martin Markl</a> ;;; This paper is a continuation of <a href="/abs/0809.1158">arXiv:0809.1158</a>, dealing with a general, not-necessarily torsion-free, connection. It characterizes all possible systems of generators for vector-field valued operators that depend naturally on a set of vector fields and a linear connection, describes the size of the space of such operators and proves the existence of an `ideal' basis consisting of operators with given leading terms which satisfy the (generalized) Bianchi-Ricci identities without corrections.
