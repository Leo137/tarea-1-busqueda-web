Internal categories, anafunctors and localisations;;; David M. Roberts, ;;; We show that given a category S (not necessarily finitely complete!) and a 2-category Cat'(S)\subset Cat(S) of internal categories in S, closed under some natural operations, the bicategorical localisation Cat'(S)[W_E^{-1}] exists for W_E a class of weak equivalences analogous to fully faithful and essentially surjective functors. Secondly we show that this localisation is given by a bicategory with anafunctors as 1-arrows when S is a site, and give conditions when various such bicategories of anafunctors are equivalent. While the connections to stacks are not pursued here, this work provides a precise setting to the claim that stacks on arbitrary sites are internal groupoids up to essential equivalence. Finally, we make some conjectural comments about localisation of bicategories qua (\infty,2)-categories.
