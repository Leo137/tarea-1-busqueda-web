Geometric Models with Co-occurrence Groups;;; Joan Bruna,,  <a href="/find/cs/1/au:+Mallat_S/0/1/0/all/0/1">St&#xe9;phane Mallat</a> ;;; A geometric model of sparse signal representations is introduced for classes of signals. It is computed by optimizing co-occurrence groups with a maximum likelihood estimate calculated with a Bernoulli mixture model. Applications to face image compression and MNIST digit classification illustrate the applicability of this model.
