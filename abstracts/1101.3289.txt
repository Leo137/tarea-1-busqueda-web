Monotone tail and moment ratio properties of Student&#x27;s family of  distributions;;; Iosif Pinelis, ;;; Let G_p denote the tail function of Student's distribution with p degrees of freedom. It is shown that the ratio G_q(x)/G_p(x) is decreasing in x&gt;0 for any p and q such that 0&lt;p&lt;q\le\infty. Therefore, G_q(x)&lt;G_p(x) for all such p and q and all x&gt;0. Corollaries on the monotonicity of (generalized) moments and ratios thereof are also given.
