On the exponential transform of lemniscates;;; Bj&#xf6;rn Gustafssom,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Tkachev_V/0/1/0/all/0/1">Vladimir G. Tkachev</a> ;;; It is known that the exponential transform of a quadrature domain is a rational function for which the denominator has a certain separable form. In the present paper we show that the exponential transform of lemniscate domains in general are not rational functions, of any form. Several examples are given to illustrate the general picture. The main tool used is that of polynomial and meromorphic resultants.
