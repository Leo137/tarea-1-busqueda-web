Spectral Analysis of Diffusions with Jump Boundary;;; Martin Kolb,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Wubker_A/0/1/0/all/0/1">Achim W&#xfc;bker</a> ;;; In this paper we consider one-dimensional diffusions with constant coefficients in a finite interval with jump boundary and a certain deterministic jump distribution. We use coupling methods in order to identify the spectral gap in the case of a large drift and prove that that there is a threshold drift above which the bottom of the spectrum no longer depends on the drift. As a Corollary to our result we are able to answer two questions concerning elliptic eigenvalue problems with non-local boundary conditions formulated previously by Iddo Ben-Ari and Ross Pinsky.
