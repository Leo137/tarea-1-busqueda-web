Chromatic statistics for Catalan and Fu&#xdf;-Catalan numbers;;; Roland Bacher, (Universit&#xe9; Grenoble I),  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Krattenthaler_C/0/1/0/all/0/1">Christian Krattenthaler</a> (Universit&#xe4;t Wien) ;;; We refine Catalan numbers and Fu{\ss}-Catalan numbers by introducing colour statistics for triangulations of polygons and $d$-dimensional generalisations there-of which we call Fu{\ss}-Catalan complexes. Our refinements consist in showing that the number of triangulations, respectively Fu{\ss}-Catalan complexes, with a given colour distribution of its vertices is given by closed product formulae. The crucial ingredient in the proof is the Lagrange-Good inversion formula.
