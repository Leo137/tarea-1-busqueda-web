Variable selection through CART;;; Marie Sauv&#xe9;,,  <a href="/find/math,stat/1/au:+Tuleau_Malot_C/0/1/0/all/0/1">Christine Tuleau-Malot</a> ;;; This paper deals with variable selection in the regression and binary classification frameworks. It proposes an automatic and exhaustive procedure which relies on the use of the CART algorithm and on model selection via penalization. This work, of theoretical nature, aims at determining adequate penalties, i.e. penalties which allow to get oracle type inequalities justifying the performance of the proposed procedure. Since the exhaustive procedure can not be executed when the number of variables is too big, a more practical procedure is also proposed and still theoretically validated. A simulation study completes the theoretical results.
