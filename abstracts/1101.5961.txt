Pure inductive limit state and Kolmogorov&#x27;s property-II;;; Anilesh Mohari, ;;; We prove that a weaker Kolmogorov's type of asymptotic criteria is not only sufficient but also necessary for purity. As an application of our main results, we prove a translation invariant pure state on a two sided quantum spin chain in lattice dimension one gives rises only type-I or type-III factor when it is restricted to one side of the quantum spin chain. Further in case the restricted state is type-I then it admits Kolmogorov's property. We give a complete classification for the class of translation invariant dynamics on quantum spin chain which admits Kolmogorov's property. The main result says that two translation dynamical systems with states admitting Kolmogorov's property are isomorphic. It surprises once more that our intuition in classical probability has it's limitation to understand quantum situation as class of isomorphism in the quantum spin chain need not be local as in Ornstein's isomorphism [Or]. We also extend results on one-dimensional lattice to higher dimensional lattices.
