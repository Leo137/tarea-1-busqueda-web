Existence of orbits with non-zero torsion for certain types of surface  diffeomorphisms;;; Fran&#xe7;ois B&#xe9;guin,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Boubaker_Z/0/1/0/all/0/1">Zouhour Rezig Boubaker</a> ;;; The present paper concerns the dynamics of surface diffeomorphisms. Given a diffeomorphism $f$ of a surface $S$, the \emph{torsion} of the orbit of a point $z\in S$ is, roughly speaking, the average speed of rotation of the tangent vectors under the action of the derivative of $f$, along the orbit of $z$ under $f$. The purpose of the paper is to identify some situations where there exist measures and orbits with non-zero torsion. We prove that every area preserving diffeomorphism of the disc which coincides with the identity near the boundary has an orbit with non-zero torsion. We also prove that a diffeomorphism of the torus $\mathbb{T}^2$, isotopic to the identity, whose rotation set has non-empty interior, has an orbit with non-zero torsion.
