Diagram calculus for a type affine $C$ Temperley--Lieb algebra, II;;; Dana C. Ernst, ;;; In a previous paper, we presented an infinite dimensional associative diagram algebra that satisfies the relations of the generalized Temperley--Lieb algebra having a basis indexed by the fully commutative elements (in the sense of Stembridge) of the Coxeter group of type affine $C$. We also provided an explicit description of a basis for the diagram algebra. In this paper, we show that this diagrammatic representation is faithful. The results of this paper will be used to construct a Jones-type trace on the Hecke algebra of type affine $C$, allowing us to non-recursively compute leading coefficients of certain Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials.
