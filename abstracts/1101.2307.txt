Hasanov</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Ozemir_C/0/1/0/all/0/1">C. &#xd6;zemir</a> ;;; A canonical variable coefficient nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation with a four dimensional symmetry group containing $\SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ group as a subgroup is considered. This typical invariance is then used to transform by a symmetry transformation a known solution that can be derived by truncating its Painlev\'e expansion and study blow-ups of these solutions in the $L_p$-norm for $p&gt;2$, $L_\infty$-norm and in the sense of distributions.
