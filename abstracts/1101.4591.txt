Convergence of the Formal Expansion for lambda_d(p) of the Monomer-Dimer  Problem for Small p;;; Paul Federbush, ;;; Shmuel Friedland and the author recently presented a formal expansion for lambda_d(p) of the monomer-dimer problem. Herein we prove that if the terms in the expansion are rearranged as a power series in p, then for sufficiently small p this series converges.
