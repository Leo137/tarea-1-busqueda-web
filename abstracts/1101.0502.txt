Structure of wave operators in R^3;;; Marius Beceanu, ;;; We prove a structure formula for the wave operators in R^3 and their adjoints for a scaling-invariant class of scalar potentials V, under the assumption that zero is neither an eigenvalue, nor a resonance for -\Delta+V. The formula implies the boundedness of wave operators on L^p spaces, 1 \leq p \leq \infty, on weighted L^p spaces, and on Sobolev spaces, as well as multilinear estimates for e^{itH} P_c. <br />When V decreases rapidly at infinity, we obtain an asymptotic expansion of the wave operators. The first term of the expansion is of order &lt; y &gt;^{-4}, commutes with the Laplacian, and exists when V \in &lt;x &gt;^{-3/2-\epsilon} L^2. <br />We also prove that the scattering operator S = W_-^* W_+ is an integrable combination of isometries. <br />The proof is based on an abstract version of Wiener's theorem, applied in a new function space.
