An efficient method for computing genus expansions and counting numbers  in the Hermitian matrix model;;; Gabriel &#xc1;lvarez,,  <a href="/find/math-ph,math/1/au:+Alonso_L/0/1/0/all/0/1">Luis Mart&#xed;nez Alonso</a>,  <a href="/find/math-ph,math/1/au:+Medina_E/0/1/0/all/0/1">Elena Medina</a> ;;; We present a method to compute the genus expansion of the free energy of Hermitian matrix models from the large N expansion of the recurrence coefficients of the associated family of orthogonal polynomials. The method is based on the Bleher-Its deformation of the model, on its associated integral representation of the free energy, and on a method for solving the string equation which uses the resolvent of the Lax operator of the underlying Toda hierarchy. As a byproduct we obtain an efficient algorithm to compute generating functions for the enumeration of labeled k-maps which does not require the explicit expressions of the coefficients of the topological expansion. Finally we discuss the regularization of singular one-cut models within this approach.
