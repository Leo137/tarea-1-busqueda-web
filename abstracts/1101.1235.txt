Equivalence of Fell Systems and their Reduced C*-Algebras;;; El-ka&#xef;oum M. Moutuou,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Tu_J/0/1/0/all/0/1">Jean-Louis Tu</a> ;;; This paper is aimed at investigating links between Fell bundles over Morita equivalent groupoids and their corresponding reduced C*-algebras. Mainly, we review the notion of Fell pairs over a Morita equivalence of groupoids, and give the analogue of the Renault's Equivalence Theorem for the reduced C*-algebras of equivalent Fell systems. Eventually, we will use this theorem to connect the reduced C*-algebra of an S^1-central groupoid extension to that of its associated Dixmier-Douady bundle.
