Minimum degree condition forcing complete graph immersion;;; Matt DeVos,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Dvorak_Z/0/1/0/all/0/1">Zden&#x11b;k Dvo&#x159;&#xe1;k</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Fox_J/0/1/0/all/0/1">Jacob Fox</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+McDonald_J/0/1/0/all/0/1">Jessica McDonald</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Mohar_B/0/1/0/all/0/1">Bojan Mohar</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Scheide_D/0/1/0/all/0/1">Diego Scheide</a> ;;; An immersion of a graph $H$ into a graph $G$ is a one-to-one mapping $f:V(H) \to V(G)$ and a collection of edge-disjoint paths in $G$, one for each edge of $H$, such that the path $P_{uv}$ corresponding to edge $uv$ has endpoints $f(u)$ and $f(v)$. The immersion is strong if the paths $P_{uv}$ are internally disjoint from $f(V(H))$. It is proved that for every positive integer $t$, every simple graph of minimum degree at least $200t$ contains a strong immersion of the complete graph $K_t$. For dense graphs one can say even more. If the graph has order $n$ and has $2cn^2$ edges, then there is a strong immersion of the complete graph on at least $c^2 n$ vertices in $G$ in which each path $P_{uv}$ is of length 2. As an application of these results, we resolve a problem raised by Paul Seymour by proving that the line graph of every simple graph with average degree $d$ has a clique minor of order at least $cd^{3/2}$, where $c&gt;0$ is an absolute constant. For small values of $t$, $1\le t\le 7$, every simple graph of minimum degree at least $t-1$ contains an immersion of $K_t$ (Lescure and Meyniel, DeVos et al.). We provide a general class of examples showing that this does not hold when $t$ is large.
