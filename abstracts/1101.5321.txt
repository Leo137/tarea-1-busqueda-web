The m&#xe9;nage problem with a known mathematician;;; Vladimir Shevelev, ;;; We give a solution of the following combinatorial problem: "A known mathematician N found himself with his wife among the guests, which were $n(\geq3)$ married couples. After seating the ladies on every other chair at a circular table, N was the first offered to choose an arbitrary chair but not side by side with his wife. To find the number of ways of seating of other men after N chose a chair (under the condition that no husband is beside his wife)." We discuss also the problem: "For which values of $n$ the number of ways of seating of other men does not depend on a choice by N his chair?"
