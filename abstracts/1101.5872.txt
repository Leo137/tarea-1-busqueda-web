Some Positivstellens&#xe4;tze in real closed valued fields;;; Noa Lavi, ;;; The purpose of this paper is to give a generalization of Hilbert's seventeenth problem in real closed valued fields. That is, for some definable set of the form $\{x \in K^n | \nu(\vec{p}(x))\ge \nu(\vec{q}(x)) \} $, we would like to give an algebraic characterization of the set of polynomials which get only non-negative values on it. Using model theoretic methods, we give a general characterization of the positive semi-definite polynomials for any definable set with a Ganzstellensatz, and we also give a representation of those polynomials in the sense of Hilbert 17th problem (that is, in terms of sums of squares) for definable sets from a certain kind.
