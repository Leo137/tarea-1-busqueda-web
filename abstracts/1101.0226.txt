On the derived functors of destabilization at odd primes;;; Geoffrey Powell, ;;; An explicit chain complex is constructed to calculate the derived functors of destabilization at an odd prime, generalizing constructions of Zarati and of Hung and Sum. These methods are based on the ideas of Singer and also apply at the prime two. These results are applied to give structural results on the derived functors of destabilization.
