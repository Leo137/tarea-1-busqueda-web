Homographic scheme for Riccati equation;;; Fran&#xe7;ois Dubois, (LM-Orsay),  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Saidi_A/0/1/0/all/0/1">Abdelkader Sa&#xef;di</a> (IRMA) ;;; In this paper we present a numerical scheme for the resolution of matrix Riccati equation, usualy used in control problems. The scheme is unconditionnaly stable and the solution is definite positive at each time step of the resolution. We prove the convergence in the scalar case and present several numerical experiments for classical test cases.
