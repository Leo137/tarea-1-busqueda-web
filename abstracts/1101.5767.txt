Towards representation stability for the second homology of the Torelli  group;;; S&#xf8;ren K. Boldsen,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Dollerup_M/0/1/0/all/0/1">Mia Hauge Dollerup</a> ;;; We show for g &gt; 6 that the second homology group of the Torelli group of a surface of genus g and 1 boundary component is generated as an Sp(2g,Z)-module by the image under the stabilization map of the second homology group of the Torelli group of a surface of genus 6 and 1 boundary component. In the process we also show that the quotient of the complex of arcs with identity permutation by the Torelli group is (g-2)-connected, for one or two boundary components.
