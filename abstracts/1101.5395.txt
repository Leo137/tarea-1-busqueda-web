Homology operations and cosimplicial infinite loop spaces. II;;; Philip Hackney, ;;; Previously we constructed operations in the mod 2 homology spectral sequence associated to a cosimplicial E_\infty-space X. According to Bousfield, the correct target for this spectral sequence is the homology of Tot X. Noting that in this setting Tot X is an E_\infty-space, we show that our operations agree with the usual Araki-Kudo operations in the target. We also prove that the multiplication in the spectral sequence agrees with the multiplication in H_*(Tot X).
