Information sets from defining sets in abelian codes;;; Jos&#xe9; Joaqu&#xed;n Bernal,,  <a href="/find/cs,math/1/au:+Simon_J/0/1/0/all/0/1">Juan Jacobo Sim&#xf3;n</a> ;;; We describe a technique to construct a set of check positions (and hence an information set) for every abelian code solely in terms of its defining set. This generalizes that given by Imai in \cite{Imai} in the case of binary TDC codes.
