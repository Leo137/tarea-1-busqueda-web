About the Geometry and Regularity of Largest Subsolutions for a Free  Boundary Problem in R2: Elliptic Case;;; Betul Orcan, ;;; We study geometric and regularity properties of the largest subsolution of a one-phase free boundary problem under a very general free boundary condition in R2. Moreover, we provide density bounds for the positivity set and its complement near the free boundary.
