Large data low regularity scattering results for the 3D wave equation on  the Euclidian space;;; Anne-Sophie de Suzzoni, ;;; We will consider the resolution of the 3D non linear wave equation under the assumption of spherical symmetry on the euclidian space. For this purpose, we will build a non trivial measure on distributions such that there exists a set of full measurement onto which the flow is globally defined. We will then discuss different properties of the solutions.
