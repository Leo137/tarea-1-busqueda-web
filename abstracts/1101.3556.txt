On the Spectral Gap of Brownian Motion with Jump Boundary;;; Martin Kolb,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Wubker_A/0/1/0/all/0/1">Achim W&#xfc;bker</a> ;;; In this paper we consider the Brownian motion with jump boundary and present a new proof of a recent result of Li, Leung and Rakesh concerning the exact convergence rate in the one-dimensional case. Our methods are different and mainly probabilistic relying on coupling methods adapted to the special situation under investigation. Moreover, we answer a question raised by Ben-Ari and Pinsky concerning the dependence of the spectral gap on the jump distribution in a multi-dimensional setting.
