On images of sofic systems;;; Wolfgang Krieger, ;;; Let $\Sigma$ and $\bar\Sigma$ be fnite alphabets. For a topologically transitive sofic system $ X\subset \Sigma^{\Bbb Z}$ and a sofic system $\bar X\subset \bar\Sigma^{\Bbb Z}$ we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a homomorphism from $X$ to $\bar X$. For a topologically transitive sofic system $X \subset \Sigma^{\Bbb Z}$ and a topologically transitive aperiodic sofic system $\bar X\subset \bar\Sigma^{\Bbb Z}$ we give a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a homomophism of $X$ onto $\bar X$.
