Central Limit for the Products of Free Random Variables;;; Keang-Po Ho, ;;; The central limit for the products of identically-distributed positive free random variables are studied by evaluating all the moments of the limit distribution. If the logarithm of the free random variables are zero mean with unity variance, the central limit is found to confine between exp(+/- c_0) with c_0 ~ 2.08. This central limit distribution is not the same but very close to the log-semicircle distribution.
