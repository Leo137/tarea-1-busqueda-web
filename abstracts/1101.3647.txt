Notes on absolute Hodge classes;;; Fran&#xe7;ois Charles,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Schnell_C/0/1/0/all/0/1">Christian Schnell</a> ;;; We survey the theory of absolute Hodge classes. The notes include a full proof of Deligne's theorem on absolute Hodge classes on abelian varieties as well as a discussion of other topics, such as the field of definition of Hodge loci and the Kuga-Satake construction.
