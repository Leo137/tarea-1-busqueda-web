The Egoroff Theorem for Operator-Valued Measures in Locally Convex  Spaces;;; J&#xe1;n Halu&#x161;ka,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Hutnik_O/0/1/0/all/0/1">Ondrej Hutn&#xed;k</a> ;;; The Egoroff theorem for measurable $\bold X$-valued functions and operator-valued measures $\bold m: \Sigma \to L(\bold X, \bold Y)$, where $\Sigma$ is a $\sigma$-algebra of subsets of $T \neq \emptyset$ and $\bold X$, $\bold Y$ are both locally convex spaces, is proved. The measure is supposed to be atomic and the convergence of functions is net.
