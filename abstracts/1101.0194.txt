Universal Models via Embedding and Reduction for Locally Conformal  Symplectic Structures;;; Juan C. Marrero,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Torres_D/0/1/0/all/0/1">David Mart&#xed;nez Torres</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Padron_E/0/1/0/all/0/1">Edith Padron</a> ;;; We obtain universal models for several types of locally conformal symplectic manifolds via pullback or reduction. The relation with recent embedding results for locally conformal K\"ahler manifolds is discussed.
