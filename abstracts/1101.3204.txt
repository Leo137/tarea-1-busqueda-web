Tur&#xe1;n Inequalities for Three Term Recurrences with Monotonic  Coefficients;;; Ilia Krasikov, ;;; We establish some new Tur\'an's type inequalities for orthogonal polynomials defined by a three-term recurrence with monotonic coefficients. As a corollary we deduce asymptotic bounds on the extreme zeros of orthogonal polynomials with polynomially growing coefficients of the three-term recurrence.
