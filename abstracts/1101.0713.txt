Shrinkers, expanders, and the unique continuation beyond generic blowup  in the heat flow for harmonic maps between spheres;;; Pawe&#x142; Biernat,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Bizon_P/0/1/0/all/0/1">Piotr Bizo&#x144;</a> ;;; Using mixed analytical and numerical methods we investigate the development of singularities in the heat flow for corotational harmonic maps from the $d$-dimensional sphere to itself for $3\leq d\leq 6$. By gluing together shrinking and expanding asymptotically self-similar solutions we construct global weak solutions which are smooth everywhere except for a sequence of times $T_1&lt;T_2&lt;...&lt;T_k&lt;\infty$ at which there occurs the type I blow-up at one of the poles of the sphere. We show that in the generic case the continuation beyond blow-up is unique, the topological degree of the map changes by one at each blow-up time $T_i$, and eventually the solution comes to rest at the zero energy constant map.
