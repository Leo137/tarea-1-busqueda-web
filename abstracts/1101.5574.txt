Limits of sequences of maximal monotone operators;;; Yboon Garc&#xed;a,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Lassonde_M/0/1/0/all/0/1">Marc Lassonde</a> ;;; We show that the lower limit of a sequence of maximal monotone operators on a reflexive Banach space is a representable monotone operator. As a consequence, we obtain that the variational sum of maximal monotone operators and the variational composition of a maximal monotone operator with a linear continuous operator are both representable monotone operators.
