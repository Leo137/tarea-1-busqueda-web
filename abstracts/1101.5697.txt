Recollements and Hochschild theory;;; Yang Han, ;;; Two constructions of recollements of derived categories of algebras are provided. Triangulated functors in recollements of derived categories of algebras and tensor product algebras are realized as derived functors of the same forms. These results are applied to observe the relations between recollements of derived categories of algebras and smoothness and Hochschild (co)homology of algebras.
