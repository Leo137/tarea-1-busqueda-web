Brownian motion, reflection groups and Tanaka formula;;; Nizar Demni, (IRMAR),  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Lepingle_D/0/1/0/all/0/1">Dominique L&#xe9;pingle</a> (MAPMO) ;;; In the setting of finite reflection groups, we prove that the projection of a Brownian motion onto a closed Weyl chamber is another Brownian motion normally reflected on the walls of the chamber. Our proof is probabilistic and the decomposition we obtain may be seen as a multidimensional extension of Tanaka's formula for linear Brownian motion. The paper is closed with a description of the boundary process through the local times at zero of the distances from the initial process to the facets.
