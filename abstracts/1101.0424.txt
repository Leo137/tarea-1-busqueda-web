Two-dimensional Id&#xe8;les with Cycle Module Coefficients;;; Oliver Braunling, ;;; We give a flasque resolution of the Zariski sheaves of Rost cycle modules in terms of 2-dimensional complete id\`eles on surfaces. We give explicit formulas relating this id\`ele resolution with the Gersten-type and \v{C}ech resolution. As an application we recover an old formula expressing intersection multiplicities in terms of tame symbols and a \v{C}ech analogue thereof. We show that this approach is workable for explicit computations.
