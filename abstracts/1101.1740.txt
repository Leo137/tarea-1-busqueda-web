Optimal stopping for the predictive maintenance of a structure subject  to corrosion;;; Beno&#xee;te de Saporta,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Dufour_F/0/1/0/all/0/1">Fran&#xe7;ois Dufour</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Zhang_H/0/1/0/all/0/1">Huilong Zhang</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Elegbede_C/0/1/0/all/0/1">Charles Elegbede</a> ;;; We present a numerical method to compute the optimal maintenance time for a complex dynamic system applied to an example of maintenance of a metallic structure subject to corrosion. An arbitrarily early intervention may be uselessly costly, but a late one may lead to a partial/complete failure of the system, which has to be avoided. One must therefore find a balance between these too simple maintenance policies. To achieve this aim, we model the system by a stochastic hybrid process. The maintenance problem thus corresponds to an optimal stopping problem. We propose a numerical method to solve the optimal stopping problem and optimize the maintenance time for this kind of processes.
