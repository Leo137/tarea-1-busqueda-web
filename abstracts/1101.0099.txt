Singularities of the wave trace near cluster points of the length  spectrum;;; Yves Colin de Verdi&#xe8;re,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Guillemin_V/0/1/0/all/0/1">Victor Guillemin</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Jerison_D/0/1/0/all/0/1">David Jerison</a> ;;; Let $-\lambda_j$ be the eigenvalues of the Laplace operator on the unit disk with Dirichlet conditions. The distribution $h(t) = \sum_j e^{i\sqrt\lambda_j t}$ is the trace of the solution operator of the wave equation on the disk. It is well known that $h$ has isolated singularities at the lengths of the reflecting geodesics. In particular, $h$ is singular at $t_k$, the perimeter of the regular inscribed polygon with $k$ sides. Evidently, $t_k &lt; 2\pi$, the perimeter of the circle, and $t_k$ tends to $2\pi$. In this paper, we show that $h(t)$ is infinitely differentiable as $t$ tends to $2\pi$ from the right.
