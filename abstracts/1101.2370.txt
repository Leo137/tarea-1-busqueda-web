A non regular Fr&#xf6;licher Lie group of diffeomorphisms;;; Jean-Pierre Magnot, ;;; We show that a group of diffeomorphisms $\D$ on the open unit interval $I,$ equipped with the topology of uniform convergence on any compact set of the derivatives at any order, is non regular: the exponential map is not defined for some path of the Lie algebra. The non integrable path that we exhibit appears also as a trivial solution of the Burger's equation.
