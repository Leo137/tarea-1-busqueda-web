Convergence in law of the minimum of a branching random walk;;; Elie Aidekon, ;;; We consider the minimum of a super-critical branching random walk. In \cite{addario-berry-reed}, Addario-Berry and Reed proved the tightness of the minimum centered around its mean value. We show that a convergence in law holds, giving the analog of a well-known result of Bramson \cite{bramson83} in the case of the branching Brownian motion.
