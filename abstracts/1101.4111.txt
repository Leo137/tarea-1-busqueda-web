A Salvetti complex for Toric Arrangements and its fundamental group;;; Giacomo d&#x27;Antonio,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Delucchi_E/0/1/0/all/0/1">Emanuele Delucchi</a> ;;; We describe a combinatorial model for the complement of a complexified toric arrangement by using nerves of acyclic categories. This generalizes recent work of Moci and Settepanella on thick toric arrangements. Moreover, we compute its fundamental group by finding a (finite) presentation.
