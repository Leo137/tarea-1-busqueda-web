Homology operations and cosimplicial infinite loop spaces. I;;; Philip Hackney, ;;; Consider the mod 2 homology spectral sequence associated to a cosimplicial space X. We construct external operations whose target is the spectral sequence associated to E\Sigma_2 \times_{\Sigma_2} (X\times X). If X is a cosimplicial E_\infty-space, we couple these external operations with the structure map E\Sigma_2 \times_{\Sigma_2} (X\times X) \to X to produce internal operations in the spectral sequence. We do not know if these agree with the operations previously constructed by Jim Turner in this situation, but in the sequel we show that they agree with the usual Araki-Kudo operations on the abutment H_*(Tot X).
