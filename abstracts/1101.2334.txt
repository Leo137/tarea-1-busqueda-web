Conformal Gravity with the Dirac Fields;;; Luca Fabbri, ;;; In a recent paper we have constructed the conformal theory of gravitation with both torsion and metric; this background having both torsion and metric is the best adapted to host matter field having both spin and energy and therefore in this paper we shall study the simplest spinor field described by the Dirac field deriving the matter field equations together with the spin and energy densities and eventually we check that both conservation laws and trace condition are satisfied.
