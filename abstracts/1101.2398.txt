Convergence of capillary fluid models: from the non-local to the local  Korteweg model;;; Fr&#xe9;d&#xe9;ric Charve,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Haspot_B/0/1/0/all/0/1">Boris Haspot</a> ;;; In this paper we are interested in the barotropic compressible Navier-Stokes system endowed with a non-local capillarity tensor depending on a small parameter $\epsilon$ such that it heuristically tends to the local Korteweg system. After giving some physical motivations related to the theory of non-classical shocks (see [28]) we prove global well-posedness (in the whole space $R^d$ with $d\geq 2$) for the non-local model and we also prove the convergence, as $\epsilon$ goes to zero, to the solution of the local Korteweg system.
