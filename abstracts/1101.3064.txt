Monads with arities and their associated theories;;; Clemens Berger,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Mellies_P/0/1/0/all/0/1">Paul-Andr&#xe9; Melli&#xe8;s</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Weber_M/0/1/0/all/0/1">Mark Weber</a> ;;; After a review of the concept of "monad with arities" we show that the category of algebras for such a monad has a canonical dense generator. This is used to extend the correspondence between finitary monads on sets and Lawvere's algebraic theories to a general correspondence between monads and theories for a given category with arities. As application we determine arities for the free groupoid monad on involutive graphs and recover the symmetric simplicial nerve characterisation of groupoids.
