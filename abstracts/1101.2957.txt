Finite Sholander Trees, Trees, and their Betweenness;;; Va&#x161;ek Chv&#xe1;tal,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Rautenbach_D/0/1/0/all/0/1">Dieter Rautenbach</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Schafer_P/0/1/0/all/0/1">Philipp Matthias Sch&#xe4;fer</a> ;;; We provide a proof of Sholander's claim (Trees, lattices, order, and betweenness, Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 3, 369-381 (1952)) concerning the representability of collections of so-called segments by trees, which yields a characterization of the interval function of a tree. Furthermore, we streamline Burigana's characterization (Tree representations of betweenness relations defined by intersection and inclusion, Mathematics and Social Sciences 185, 5-36 (2009)) of tree betweenness and provide a relatively short proof.
