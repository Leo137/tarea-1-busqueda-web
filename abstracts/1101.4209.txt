Brushing the hairs of transcendental entire functions;;; Krzysztof Bara&#x144;ski,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Jarque_X/0/1/0/all/0/1">Xavier Jarque</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Rempe_L/0/1/0/all/0/1">Lasse Rempe</a> ;;; Let f be a hyperbolic transcendental entire function of finite order in the Eremenko-Lyubich class (or a finite composition of such maps), and suppose that f has a unique Fatou component. We show that the Julia set of $f$ is a Cantor bouquet; i.e. is ambiently homeomorphic to a straight brush in the sense of Aarts and Oversteegen. In particular, we show that any two such Julia sets are ambiently homeomorphic. We also show that if $f\in\B$ has finite order (or is a finite composition of such maps), but is not necessarily hyperbolic, then the Julia set of f contains a Cantor bouquet. <br />As part of our proof, we describe, for an arbitrary function $f\in\B$, a natural compactification of the dynamical plane by adding a "circle of addresses" at infinity.
