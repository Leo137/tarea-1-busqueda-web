Continuous rational functions on real and $p$-adic varieties;;; J&#xe1;nos Koll&#xe1;r, (Princeton Univ) ;;; This note studies, and partially solves, 3 elementary questions about continuous rational functions on real (and p-adic) algebraic varieties: Can one restrict such a function to a subvariety? Can one extend such a function from a subvariety? Which linear equations can be solved using such functions?
