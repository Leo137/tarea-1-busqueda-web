Parameter rigid actions of simply connected nilpotent Lie groups;;; Hirokazu Maruhashi, ;;; We show that for a locally free action of a simply connected nilpotent Lie group on a compact manifold, if every real valued cocycle is cohomologous to a constant cocycle, then the action is parameter rigid. The converse is true if the action has a dense orbit. Using this, we construct parameter rigid actions of simply connected nilpotent Lie groups whose Lie algebras admit rational structures with graduations. This generalizes the results of dos Santos concerning the Heisenberg groups.
