Hadamard grade of power series;;; J.-P. Allouche,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+France_M/0/1/0/all/0/1">M. Mend&#xe8;s France</a> ;;; The Hadamard product of two power series $\sum a_n z^n$ and $\sum b_n z^n$ is the power series $\sum a_n b_n z^n$. We define the (Hadamard) grade of a power series $A$ to be the least number (finite or infinite) of algebraic power series, the Hadamard product of which equals $A$. We study and discuss this notion.
