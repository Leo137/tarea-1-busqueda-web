Multiple Dedekind Zeta Functions;;; Ivan Horozov, ;;; In this paper we define multiple Dedekind zeta functions as a new type of iterated integrals. This new class of functions have many properties. They can be written as infinite sums. They have integral representation and meromorphic continuation. We also prove that at the positive integers the multiple Dedekind zeta values are periods. In particular, the Dedekind zeta function can be written in terms of the new type of iterated integral and at the positive integers the corresponding iterated integrals give periods.
