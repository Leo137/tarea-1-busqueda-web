Geometric extensions of many-particle Hardy inequalities;;; Douglas Lundholm, ;;; The so-called ground state representation for the Laplacian on a subdomain of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is used to derive certain many-particle Hardy inequalities in a simple and systematic way. This includes geometric extensions of the standard Hardy inequalities to involve volumes of simplices spanned by a subset of points. Clifford/multilinear algebra is employed to simplify geometric computations.
