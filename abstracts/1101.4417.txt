Critical graphs without triangles: an optimum density construction;;; Wesley Pegden, ;;; We construct dense, triangle-free, chromatic-critical graphs of chromatic number k for all k&gt;/-4. For k&gt;/-6 our constructions have &gt;(1/4-{\espilon})n^2 edges, which is asymptotically best possible by Tur\'an's theorem. We also demonstrate (nonconstructively) the existence of dense pentagon-and-triangle-free k-critical graphs for any k&gt;/-4, again with a best possible density of &gt;(1/4-{\espilon})n^2 edges for k&gt;/-6. The families of triangle-free and pentagon-and-triangle-free graphs are thus rare examples where we know the correct maximal density of k-critical members (k&gt;/-6). We also construct dense 4-critical graphs of any odd-girth.
