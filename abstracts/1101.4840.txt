Uniform algebras and approximation on manifolds;;; H&#xe5;kan Samuelsson,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Wold_E/0/1/0/all/0/1">Erlend Forn&#xe6;ss Wold</a> ;;; Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb{C}^n$ be a bounded domain and let $\mathcal{A} \subset \mathcal{C}(\bar{\Omega})$ be a uniform algebra generated by a set $F$ of holomorphic and pluriharmonic functions. Under natural assumptions on $\Omega$ and $F$ we show that the only obstruction to $\mathcal{A} = \mathcal{C}(\bar{\Omega})$ is that there is a holomorphic disk $D \subset \bar{\Omega}$ such that all functions in $F$ are holomorphic on $D$, i.e., the only obstruction is the obvious one. This generalizes work by A. Izzo. We also have a generalization of Wermer's maximality theorem to the (distinguished boundary of the) bidisk.
