Scaling limits of random trees and planar maps;;; Jean-Fran&#xe7;ois Le Gall, (LM-Orsay),  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Miermont_G/0/1/0/all/0/1">Gr&#xe9;gory Miermont</a> (LM-Orsay) ;;; These are the notes for a series of lectures given at the Clay Mathematical Institute Summer School in Buzios, July 11 - August 7, 2010. We review some of the recent aspects of scaling limits of random trees and planar maps, in particular via their relations with bijective enumeration and Gromov-Hausdorff convergence.
