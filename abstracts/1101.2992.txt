A conjecture implying the existence of non-convex Chebyshev sets in  infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces;;; Biagio Ricceri, ;;; In this paper, we propose the study of a conjecture whose affirmative solution would provide an example of a non-convex Chebyshev set in an infinite-dimensional real Hilbert space.
