Being Van Kampen is a universal property;;; Pawel Sobocinski, (DSSE, ECS, University of Southampton),  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Heindel_T/0/1/0/all/0/1">Tobias Heindel</a> (Laboratoire d&#x27;Informatique de Paris-Nord, Universit&#xe9; de Paris, France) ;;; Colimits that satisfy the Van Kampen condition have interesting exactness properties. We show that the elementary presentation of the Van Kampen condition is actually a characterisation of a universal property in the associated bicategory of spans. The main theorem states that Van Kampen cocones are precisely those diagrams in a category that induce bicolimit diagrams in its associated bicategory of spans, provided that the category has pullbacks and enough colimits.
