Connectedness of fractals associated with Arnoux-Rauzy substitutions;;; Val&#xe9;rie Berth&#xe9;,,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Jolivet_T/0/1/0/all/0/1">Timo Jolivet</a>,  <a href="/find/math/1/au:+Siegel_A/0/1/0/all/0/1">Anne Siegel</a> ;;; Rauzy fractals are compact sets with fractal boundary that can be associated with any unimodular Pisot irreducible substitution. These fractals can be defined as the Hausdorff limit of a sequence of compact planar sets, where each set is the projection of a finite union of faces of unit cubes. We exploit this combinatorial definition to prove the connectedness of the fractal associated with any finite product of Arnoux-Rauzy substitutions.
